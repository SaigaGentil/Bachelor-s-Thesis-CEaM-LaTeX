  abstract  = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), although hardly a new technology, have recently gained a prominent role in many industries being widely used not only among enthusiastic consumers, but also in high demanding professional situations, and will have a massive societal impact over the coming years. However, the operation of UAVs is fraught with serious safety risks, such as collisions with dynamic obstacles (birds, other UAVs, or randomly thrown objects). These collision scenarios are complex to analyze in real-time, sometimes being computationally impossible to solve with existing State of the Art (SoA) algorithms, making the use of UAVs an operational hazard and therefore significantly reducing their commercial applicability in urban environments. In this work, a conceptual framework for both stand-alone and swarm (networked) UAVs is introduced, with a focus on the architectural requirements of the collision avoidance subsystem to achieve acceptable levels of safety and reliability. The SoA principles for collision avoidance against stationary objects are reviewed and a novel approach is described, using deep learning techniques to solve the computational intensive problem of real-time collision avoidance with dynamic objects. The proposed framework includes a web-interface allowing the full control of UAVs as remote clients with a supervisor cloud-based platform. The feasibility of the proposed approach was demonstrated through experimental tests using a UAV, developed from scratch using the proposed framework. Test flight results are presented for an autonomous UAV monitored from multiple countries across the world.},

The machine learning model keeps learning from the human reviewers through a continuous learning loop. The trained model is then deployed back to the edge.

  abstract     = {During the last few years, awareness has been raised about a number of "blind" attacks that can be performed against the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and similar protocols. The consequences of these attacks range from throughput reduction to broken connections or data corruption. These attacks rely on the attacker's ability to guess or know the five-tuple (Protocol, Source Address, Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port) that identifies the transport protocol instance to be attacked. This document describes a number of simple and efficient methods for the selection of the client port number, such that the possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced. While this is not a replacement for cryptographic methods for protecting the transport-protocol instance, the aforementioned port selection algorithms provide improved security with very little effort and without any key management overhead. The algorithms described in this document are local policies that may be incrementally deployed and that do not violate the specifications of any of the transport protocols that may benefit from them, such as TCP, UDP, UDP-lite, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), and RTP (provided that the RTP application explicitly signals the RTP and RTCP port numbers). This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.}

@article{mscdronesinthecloud,
  abstract = {With IoT devices becoming both smaller and more computationally powerful,
              new cloud computing architectures have evolved. These new architectures have
              presented an opportunity to use IoT for more purposes, such as autonomous
              drones which is what will be focused on in this thesis. As a result of this, many
              cloud computing platforms now offer support for hosting IoT networks. Amaazon Web Services will be used for developing and hosting the IoT networks. The
              three IoT architectures which will be investigated in this thesis are Cloud, Fog,
              and Edge computing. These architectures will be evaluated using metrics relevant to a real-time IoT system. The result of the evaluation is a recommendation
              of an architecture that is the most suitable for our use case. This architecture is
              a hybrid solution that performs time-critical computations onboard the device
              and all other operations in the cloud.
              Since IoT networks can consist of many devices it might not be feasible to
              create large networks of physical devices for testing. Therefore there is a need
              to investigate whether the simulation of devices is something that can be used
              for testing, especially smart devices such as drones. As a solution to this, this
              thesis will explore the possibilities of simulating drones using AWS. The AWS
              simulation solution offers the possibility to generate large amounts of data from
              simple devices. However, this is not enough to be able to simulate a drone system
              completely since the simulated devices lack the ability to receive any input.},

UAVs are now capable of carrying out remote sensing, remote monitoring, courier delivery, and a lot more. A lot of research is happening on making UAVs more robust using energy harvesting techniques to have a better battery lifetime, network performance and to secure against attackers. UAV networks are many times used for unmanned missions. There have been many attacks on civilian, military, and industrial targets that were carried out using remotely controlled or automated UAVs. This continued misuse has led to research in preventing unauthorized UAVs from causing damage to life and property. In this paper, we present a literature review of UAVs, UAV attacks, and their prevention using anti-UAV techniques. We first discuss the different types of UAVs, the regulatory laws for UAV activities, their use cases, recreational, and military UAV incidents. After understanding their operation, various techniques for monitoring and preventing UAV attacks are described along with case studies.},
