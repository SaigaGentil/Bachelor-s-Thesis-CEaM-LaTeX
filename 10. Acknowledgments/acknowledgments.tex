\section*{\centering \Large Acknowledgements}

\begin{acknowledgements}

    Throughout the design, development, test, and documentation of my project, I have received a great deal of support and assistance, and I want to take a moment to recognize all those that have supported me both morally and financially.

    I would like to first thank my parents Emmanuel Kamere and Florence Nibakure very much. Saying thank you in words would not be anywhere close to enough. You have supported me both financially and mentally in every step of my project development, given me guidance on how to best approach and tackle all kinds of blockers I would encounter along the way. You have been one of the key pillars of my project’s implementation success.

    Next, I would like to thank my supervisor Tomasz Ocetkiewicz. First for believing in my ability to complete this project and second for the unprecedented advice and support you have given me throughout the realisation of my project. While looking for a supervisor to help me get my project to life, I didn’t hesitate to choose you mainly due to the competences that I have seen in you in the engineering area during my time at WSG university and the classes that we have had together.

    I would also like to the thank the whole computer engineering and mechatronics department for all the support that they have given me throughout my time at WSG university, the accesses to the labs, all the materials I have been able to get from you and finally all the knowledge and inspiration that you have given throughout my time at the university.

    Finally, I wouldn’t finish without thanking each one of my classmates, colleagues and friends who have been part of my support system and have given me ideas and support during the development of this project as well as my time at WSG. YOU ROCK!
