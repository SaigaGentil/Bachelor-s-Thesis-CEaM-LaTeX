\abstract
With the UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) becoming more and more popular, the need to have agile, resilient, cost-effective and highly available systems becomes eminent. Cloud computing especially AWS, which is the cloud provider of choice in this thesis, presents a great advantage at being able to provide an environment where Unmanned Aerial Systems with the aforementioned characteristics can be built. Unmanned Aerial Mobility is a sector that is growing so much that the need to have robust systems becomes also necessary to have.

In the proposed solution in this thesis, Amazon Web Services will be used as a platform to build and deploy the proposed system. The proposed system will be built using the serverless design approach, which will make the solution cost-effective, the system will also take full advantage of infrastructure as code for a more agile and highly available solution. Solution components like the UAV will be tested in simulation software but architectures for an actual non-simulated solution will also be discussed and presented.
