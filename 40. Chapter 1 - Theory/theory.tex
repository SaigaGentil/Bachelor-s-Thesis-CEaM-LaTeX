\section{Unmanned Aerial System}
\label{sec:unmanned-aerial-system}

An unmanned aerial system commonly referred to as UAS is a set comprised of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and components that support its operations. UAVs that make a UAS do not carry human pilots but are piloted remotely or autonomously. A UAS is usually comprised of four main components namely,

\begin{itemize}
    \item An unmanned aerial vehicle also known as a UAV. Every other component that make a UAS revolves around a UAV to ensure that, depending on the use case, it is able to fulfil the mission it is designed to perform.
    \item A ground control station also known as a GCS, from where human pilots can remotely pilot a UAV or upload mission payload for the UAV to execute autonomously.
    \item Sensors and devices specific to the aerial vehicles' intended mission. These can be cameras or other various sensors.
    \item A data-link between a UAV and a GCS. The data-link can be set up via LTE, Wi-Fi or satellite.
\end{itemize}

A typical UAS also includes some ways to collect telemetry from the UAV to some sort of data-lake for further analysis. The collected data can be used for machine learning to improve the UAV operational efficiency and in building sophisticated operational algorithms.

Figure \ref{fig:solution-hld-a4} shows the high-level design of the proposed unmanned aerial system.

\subsection{Unmanned Aerial Vehicle}
\label{subsec:uav}

Unmanned aerial vehicle is a term used to refer to an aerial vehicle that has no human onboard pilot but is rather piloted remotely by humans from a remote ground control station or is autonomously piloted using onboard flight algorithms. Unmanned aerial vehicles are also commonly known as UAVs, drones or remotely piloted vehicles (RPV). A UAV in itself is a system because it consists of multiple components and payload that enables it to fulfil its mission. Figure \ref{fig:uav-hld} shows a high-level design of the proposed UAV.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{uav_hld.png}

    \label{fig:uav-hld}
    \source{Own work. Designed with Microsoft Visio. Refer to \ref{subsec:ms-visio}.}
\end{figure}

As one can see from the above design, the proposed UAV consists of about 5 main components. Starting from the top going clockwise they are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A cloud infrastructure that hosts web app and data analytics services, where the UAV sends data and receives mission commands from.
    \item An on-premise ground control station where the UAV can also be controlled from.
    \item An LTE/Wi-Fi module that establishes remote network connectivity.
    \item A companion computer. This hosts multiple software like drivers for various sensors that can be attached to the computer, middleware like the MAVLink router which allows MAVLink traffic to be routed to external interfaces, and APIs built with various libraries like MAVSDK \cite{mavsdk} to enhance the UAV capability.
    \item A flight controller running PX4 firmware and is connected to various other components like the electronic speed controller (ESC), GPS, battery and other sensors or devices.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Classification of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles}
\label{subsubsec:classification-of-uavs}

UAVs come in different classifications depending on various factors like weight and payload, application, wing and rotor shape, and operational range and altitude. There is no one standard used across the industry to identify UAVs.

\section{Amazon Web Services}
\label{sec:aws}

Amazon Web Services, commonly known as AWS, is a cloud platform provided by Amazon that provides various service offerings such as platform as a service, PaaS, and infrastructure as a service, IaaS \cite{awswhatisaws2022}. AWS makes it easy for developers, engineers and businesses to deploy scalable, resilient, agile and highly available infrastructures for databases, servers, applications, storage, analytics, \textit{et cetera}. AWS offers attractive and cost saving payment strategies of which there are pay-as-you-go, save when you commit, and pay less by using more \cite{awspricing2022}.

AWS has a concept of regions, which refers to a physical location around the world, where multiple data centres are deployed in a cluster. Each cluster of data centre is called an availability zone \cite{awsregionsandazs}. AWS set this up like this to guarantee high availability and reliability of deployed resources.

\end{figure}

Cloud computing is an emerging technology that has revolutionized how businesses go online. Cloud computing has been and still is of great use in various industries, including the aerospace and energy industries. One of the many usages of cloud computing like AWS in the aerospace and energy industries is where Burak et. al developed a cloud and edge solution running on AWS that aimed at increasing turbine maintenance inspections' efficiency through automation and a serverless AWS architecture while reducing operations cost \cite{burakawswindfarm2021}. The solution proposed by Burak et al was composed of drones, machine learning and internet of things processes running on cloud and edge.

The proposed solution in this thesis also takes advantage of what AWS and cloud computing offers. Several components, like data analytics services, of the proposed solution are running on AWS. Figure \ref{fig:aws-architecture-hld} shows the AWS high-level design of the proposed solution. The details of the design are described in chapter \ref{chap:methodology-and-setup}.

\subsection{Infrastructure as code}
\label{subsec:iac}

Infrastructure as Code also known as IaC, a technique very often used in the DevOps and automation community, is an infrastructure that is provisioned through code and scripts usually written in familiar programming languages like Python, PHP, Node.JS, C\# \textit{et cetera}. The infrastructure deployed through code can be servers, databases, firewalls, full-fledged data centres \textit{et cetera}. The main advantages of defining an infrastructure as code are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Improved efficiency and consistency.
    \item Reduced human error.
    \item Infrastructure agility. An infrastructure defined as code can be deployed as many times as needed, which reduces the effort invested by developers in case a replica of an environment is needed elsewhere.
    \item It allows developers to take advantage of programming languages features like loops, variables \textit{et cetera} to build more agile infrastructures.
    \item The infrastructure can be versioned and tightly controlled. Since the infrastructure is basically standard code, it can be versioned with various versioning tools like Git or Subversion. This facilitates maintenance and makes the infrastructure easy to be rolled back, in case of issues.
    \item It helps with cost savings. Since the whole infrastructure is basically deployed automatically through code, engineers can then shift their focus to work on other important tasks.
\end{itemize}

In this thesis, Infrastructure as Code is used to its utmost potential. The AWS infrastructure is deployed as code using the AWS software development framework called AWS Cloud Development Kit or AWS CDK. AWS CDK is an open source kit provided by AWS that allows engineers to define IT infrastructures on AWS using familiar programming languages. In the source code \ref{code:route_53_records} is an example snippet from the AWS CDK app developed for the proposed solution in this thesis. The snippet represents a part that adds DNS records to the AWS Route 53 service using standard Python code. Once the AWS CDK app is deployed, the script automatically creates the resources defined in the AWS Route 53 DNS service.

\section{Simulation}
\label{sec:simulation}

The proposed solution is designed based on actual physical hardware components, but during development phases, it was observed that it was better to simulate parts of the solutions that can be simulated. This not only was deemed to save time, since everything was done through software, but it also helped save money that would be invested in buying new hardware in case replacements of parts were needed. This being said, the initial project plan was to develop a whole UAS from scratch with an actual physical UAV and components, and the next chapters will discuss on what progress was made on this front. During development of the proposed solution a simulation technique called Software-In-The-Loop or SITL \cite{Giese2021} was used to simulate the UAV. Figure \ref{fig:sitl-hld} shows the design of the proposed SITL architecture. Chapter \ref{chap:methodology-and-setup} elaborates more on this simulation technique. This technique basically allows developers to develop UAV flight logics using software and no hardware involved, even though it is possible as well to involve hardware in what is referred to as Hardware-In-The-Loop or HITL \cite{px4hitluserguide}. Chapter \ref{chap:methodology-and-setup} elaborates more on how SITL was used in this project to simulate an actual UAV with telemetry.

\subsection{GitHub}
\label{subsec:github}

One of the fundamentals of software development and coding projects generally is to version the code so that changes can be tracked overtime. Making sure that a project is versioned and maintained centrally in a repository is very important, especially where teams are working together on a similar project. Git, one of the software used for code versioning, was used in this project to track changes across various components of the overall project. In fact this thesis document itself is versioned with Git, alongside other components of the proposed solution. GitHub then comes into play to act as the single point of truth where multiple Git repositories can be pushed and managed from.
