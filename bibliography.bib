The development of UAV produced a change in the concepts regarding the architecture and operations through the evolution of their characteristics and capabilities. Thus, they generated continuous construction designs and a wide range of domains in which UAV’s can be used.},

@article{Pedro2020,
  abstract  = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), although hardly a new technology, have recently gained a prominent role in many industries being widely used not only among enthusiastic consumers, but also in high demanding professional situations, and will have a massive societal impact over the coming years. However, the operation of UAVs is fraught with serious safety risks, such as collisions with dynamic obstacles (birds, other UAVs, or randomly thrown objects). These collision scenarios are complex to analyze in real-time, sometimes being computationally impossible to solve with existing State of the Art (SoA) algorithms, making the use of UAVs an operational hazard and therefore significantly reducing their commercial applicability in urban environments. In this work, a conceptual framework for both stand-alone and swarm (networked) UAVs is introduced, with a focus on the architectural requirements of the collision avoidance subsystem to achieve acceptable levels of safety and reliability. The SoA principles for collision avoidance against stationary objects are reviewed and a novel approach is described, using deep learning techniques to solve the computational intensive problem of real-time collision avoidance with dynamic objects. The proposed framework includes a web-interface allowing the full control of UAVs as remote clients with a supervisor cloud-based platform. The feasibility of the proposed approach was demonstrated through experimental tests using a UAV, developed from scratch using the proposed framework. Test flight results are presented for an autonomous UAV monitored from multiple countries across the world.},

With AWS you pay only for the individual services you need, for as long as you use them, and without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. AWS pricing is similar to how you pay for utilities like water and electricity. You only pay for the services you consume, and once you stop using them, there are no additional costs or termination fees.},

  abstract = {In this post, we proposed a solution to automate wind turbine visual inspection using AWS services. The solution has a serverless architecture that utilizes AWS IoT, and AI/ML technologies to employ drone imaging-based inspection at the edge. The solution brings complete automation while still employing the existing expert employees into the whole inspection process when necessary. The machine learning model keeps learning from the human reviewers through a continuous learning loop. The trained model is then deployed back to the edge. Moreover, the solution can work in offline mode using AWS IoT Greengrass.},
